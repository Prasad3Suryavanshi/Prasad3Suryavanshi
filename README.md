# 👋 Hello, I'm Prasad Suryavanshi

**`BTech Student (Computer Science & Engineering - Cybersecurity)`** | **`Data & Security Enthusiast`**

I'm a dedicated university student building the foundation for a career at the intersection of **security, data, and software**. My specialization in **Cybersecurity** is complemented by a strong interest in **Data Analysis**—where I enjoy finding patterns, diagnosing problems, and crafting efficient solutions.

This GitHub is the home for my learning journey and projects, where I apply theory to practice.
